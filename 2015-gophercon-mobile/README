Demo Setup
----------------------

- Download and install Android SDK

https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html
Or, easiest way is to install Android Studio.


- Download go1.5 and build for your host.

- Set the following environment variables.

GOPATH: your go path
ANDROID_HOME: Android SDK directory
PATH: make sure $GOROOT/bin, $GOPATH/bin are included in the path

- Install the gomobile tool and run init before demo.

% go install golang.org/x/mobile/cmd/gomobile
% gomobile init

- Hello Gopher demo

% demo1.bash

For android screen mirroring, I used Mobizen (mobizen.com).
For ios screen mirroring, you can use quicktime.

- Gobind demo

% demo2.bash

- Ivy demo: In my gophercon talk, I used pre-recorded video
clips for mobile versions and ran the command line version from 
my laptop in order to emphasize the cross-platform support.

Enjoy.
